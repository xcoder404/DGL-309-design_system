        <div class="introduction__content">
          <p>
            When our parents retired to the island from Aldergrove in 1998â€“1999,
            Outback Nursery's narrative began to take root. The purchase of a
            heavily forested property was made in response to their invitation
            for us to join them in this lovely retreat. We set out on a journey,
            removing trees one by one as we entered the picturesque countryside.
            We fostered hedges and conifers, planting the seeds for our
            botanical journey, in addition to testing different methods of
            raising turkeys and pigs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outback Nursery is still standing as a reminder of our trip and a
            flowering reminder of the hopes that were sown here. We warmly
            invite you for a walk through our lush gardens, learn the tales
            stored away in each plant, and take in the glory of this botanical
            journey. Come along with us as we grow one leaf at a time.
