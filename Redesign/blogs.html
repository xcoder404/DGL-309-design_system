            <h3>Weeping Japanese Mapples</h3>

          
          <p>
            There are so many available on the market today it's a little
            overwhelming. They come in large variety of shapes and colors. The
            weeping or cascading forms are usually low growing with a
            mushroom-shaped form. Most but not all have delicate laceleaf
            foliage and are suitable for mixed borders, containers, rockeries or
            cascading over a water feature.

          <h3>Dwarf Conifers</h3>
          <p>
            Dwarf conifers are suitable for any garden, especially were space
            may be limited. They also make great rockery and container plants,
            providing year round interest and color to the landscape. The term
            dwarf can be misleading as conifers never stop growing and are long
            lived plants.

          <h3>Flowering deciduous trees</h3>
          <p>
            You know spring is here and can put the winter blues behind, at the
            sight of a deciduous tree in full bloom. While most deciduous trees
            flower in spring, there are some very nice summer flowering types.
            When choosing a tree make sure the mature size and spread will fit
            in the landscape.

          <h3>Ornamental Grasses</h3>
          <p>
            Ornamental grasses can add interest, form and texture to the
            landscape. Most grasses are easy to grow, simply water during the
            hot summer months and fertilize in spring. They need little
            maintenance other than cutting back deciduous types, (best done in
            spring) or dividing clumps that have gotten too big.

          <h3>Deciduous Flowering Shrubs</h3>
          <p>
            There are so many beautiful deciduous flowering shrubs out there,
            that I'm going to focus on 10 that have other interests or uses,
            than just flowers. Deciduous shrubs are usually pretty hardy and can
            take what the weather throws at them. Unlike broadleaved evergreens
            they aren't effected by winter burn, producing no leaves until the
            warmer spring weather.

          <h3>Japanese Maples with green foliage</h3>
          <p>
            While most people are attracted to the bright colored foliage of
            purple and yellow leaved maples, it's the green types that usually
            produce the best fall colors. Most are easy to grow and are suitable
            for full sun or partial shade.

          <p>
            A hedge can be an important addition to the garden, providing
            privacy, act as sound barrier or define property lines. Which
            hedging to choose will depend on a number of factors. Deer will be
            one of those factors and will determine which plants to pick.

          <h3>Large specimen trees</h3>
          <p>
            These are the trees that often get mistakenly planted because they
            look so good when young, not taking in account their mature size.
            They definately have a spot in the landscape but only on large lots
            or acreage. When planting large trees remember, not near power
            lines, house foundations, septic fields, drive or walkways.

          <p>
            Plants with purple leaves stand out, draw the eye and add a splash
            of color to the landscape. But if over used they become distracting
            and over powering, this also goes for blue and yellow foliage too. A
            garden should be mostly some shade of green with the brighter
            colored plants used as focal points.

          <p>
            Containers add interest to outdoor sitting areas by brightening up
            the empty spaces on decks, patios, terraces or entryways and is a
            nice solution for apartments or homes with little or no space for
            gardens. The color or shape of the containers is a personal choice,
            all one color can be very effect, as can different sized pots, often
            sold in sets.

            The ten listed below are all upright types, but very different from
            each other in form, leave type or height. Like the green leaved
            maples there are so many out there. Choosing the right one will
            depend on personal taste and the space available.
