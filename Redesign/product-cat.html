          <h1>BEECH</h1>
          <p class="part1">
            Beech trees, also known as Fagus, are pretty famous in the tree
            world. You've probably seen them around because they look pretty
            elegant with their smooth, grayish bark and leaves that have those
            serrated edges. These trees are not only nice to look at but also
            super tough. Some of them can survive for over 300 years! People
            like using their wood for making furniture, floors, and all sorts of
            crafty stuff.
          </p>
          <p class="cat-part2">
            But here's the cool part: beech trees are not just about looks and
            wood. They also provide homes and food for lots of animals and help
            keep our ecosystems healthy. So, basically, beech trees are like the
            wise old sages of the forest, standing tall and strong, making the
            world a better place.
