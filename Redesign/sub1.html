          <h1>Weeping Japanese Mapples</h1>
          <p>
            There are so many available on the market today it's a little
            overwhelming. They come in large variety of shapes and colors. The
            weeping or cascading forms are usually low growing with a
            mushroom-shaped form. Most but not all have delicate laceleaf
            foliage and are suitable for mixed borders, containers, rockeries or
            cascading over a water feature. Easy to care for, all they need is
            well-drained soil (never water-logged conditions) and sun exposure
            depends on the cultivar. Young plants may scorch in hot afternoon
            sun, especially on a deck or concrete patio. Resembling drought, the
            fine leaves curl and turn brown at the tips, if severe enough the
            whole leave is affected. Don't panic and over water, they will
            become resistant to this as they get older. Give them room to
            mature, while considered a small maple they can develop a large
            spread with age, or simply prune and shape to maintain a smaller
            size.
