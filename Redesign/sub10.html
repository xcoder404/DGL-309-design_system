          <h1>Plants with purple foliage</h1>
          <p>
            Plants with purple leaves stand out, draw the eye and add a splash
            of color to the landscape. But if over used they become distracting
            and over powering, this also goes for blue and yellow foliage too. A
            garden should be mostly some shade of green with the brighter
            colored plants used as focal points. Depending on the size of the
            garden, you can use purple in more than one bed to create a balanced
            landscape that's pleasing to the eye. For example you might use a
            tree with purple foliage in one area and carry the color through to
            another bed with purple shrubs. When using purple make sure it
            doesn't fade into the background of a building. Example: purple
            foliage would not stand out against a red or dark brown house, while
            yellow, blue or green would. There are no conifers with year round
            purple foliage that I can think of, but there are some that turn
            purple in winter, like Cryptomeria Elagans which has green foliage
            in summer and a deep purple tint in winter. Note: Most trees and
            shrubs with purple foliage need afternoon sun for the best color.
