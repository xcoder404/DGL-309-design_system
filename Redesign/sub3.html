          <h1>Flowering deciduous trees</h1>
          <p>
            You know spring is here and can put the winter blues behind, at the
            sight of a deciduous tree in full bloom. While most deciduous trees
            flower in spring, there are some very nice summer flowering types.
            When choosing a tree make sure the mature size and spread will fit
            in the landscape. Ask if the tree is suitable for our climate, the
            Comox Valley is considered ZONE 7, there are micro climates that are
            warmer than the average Temperature and able to grow the more exotic
            types like the Empress tree. Important are soil conditions, most
            require well-drained soils in winter and do not tolerate standing
            water. Try to pick trees that offer more than just blooms, example
            interesting form or leaves, fall color or unique bark for seasonal
            interest. Don't over look planting fruit trees they put on a pretty
            good display, while the blooms may be short lived, you can always
            look forward to eating the fruit.

          <h2>Cherry Ornamental 'Kwanzan' Prunus avium</h2>
          <p>
            Nothing can quite compare in spring to the stunning display of
            double pink flowers of this cultivar. A medium sized tree that's
            suitable as a single specimen or lining a long driveway. Sadly,
            ornamental cherries are not long lived and can be susceptible to
            other problems, but well worth the effort.
