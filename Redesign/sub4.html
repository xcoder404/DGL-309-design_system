          <h1>Ornamental Grasses</h1>
          <p>
            Ornamental grasses can add interest, form and texture to the
            landscape. Most grasses are easy to grow, simply water during the
            hot summer months and fertilize in spring. They need little
            maintenance other than cutting back deciduous types, (best done in
            spring) or dividing clumps that have gotten too big. The most
            important thing for success is providing the right exposure and soil
            conditions for each type of grass. There is a wide selection of
            grasses available on the market but there are some that stand out.
