          <h1>Deciduous Flowering Shrubs</h1>
          <p>
            There are so many beautiful deciduous flowering shrubs out there,
            that I'm going to focus on 10 that have other interests or uses,
            than just flowers. Deciduous shrubs are usually pretty hardy and can
            take what the weather throws at them. Unlike broadleaved evergreens
            they aren't effected by winter burn, producing no leaves until the
            warmer spring weather. Most thrive in fertile well-drained soils,
            exposure to sun or shade depends on the plant, but those with fall
            color should have some afternoon sun to produce the best color.
            Pruning can be done in spring, fall or after flowering depending on
            the type of shrub. Heavy pruning every year can effect flower
            production for the following year, so check first if the shrub
            produces flowers on old or new wood. Some like Spireas can be pruned
            to almost ground level when they become sparse on the bottom and
            will bounce back in no time. When a deciduous shrub fails its
            usually because of waterlogged soil in winter, this can cause root
            rot so be careful when picking a site.

            by summer. While not particularly showy flowers, it's the foliage
            color, drought tolerance and deer resistant's that makes this shrub
            a good choice. Suitable as a specimen shrub, rockery or low hedge.
            Needs well-drained soil in full sun and can be pruned anytime.
