          <h1>Japanese Maples with green foliage</h1>
          <p>
            While most people are attracted to the bright colored foliage of
            purple and yellow leaved maples, it's the green types that usually
            produce the best fall colors. Most are easy to grow and are suitable
            for full sun or partial shade, although too much afternoon shade can
            affect the fall color. Important is soil conditions, no Japanese
            maples will tolerate standing water, especially in winter, so plant
            only in well-drained soil. Use a slow release fertilizer in spring
            and water moderately during the summer months. Also important is
            pruning, which should only be done after any chance of frost is
            past. At the nursery we usually prune our maples in the summer time,
            this is also the time we graft our new maples. The ten listed below
            are very different from each other in both form, leaf shape and fall
            color. These ten are but a small sampling of the green leafed types
            that are available on the market today, there are so many more.
            Every year there are new cultivars available, but the ten I picked
            have stood the test of time and proven both hardy and popular.

            a an attractive broad seven-lobed leaf, that turns a rich deep
            orange in fall. Easy to grow but still fairy uncommon on the market

          <p>
            A rounded shrub-like tree reaching up to 16'-20' tall at maturity,
            but can easily be pruned to maintain a smaller size. The bright
            green leaf is seven-lobed and deeply divided with serrated edges.
            This attractive maple has brilliant red, orange and yellow fall
            color and has unique grayish-green bark.

          <h2>Koto-no-ito: Acer palmatum</h2>
          <p>
            This small maple is slow growing, reaching 10' tall with a
            vase-shaped form. The five or seven-lobed leaves are thread-like
            giving this hardy little tree a delicate look. An attractive
            golden-yellow color with an orange tint in fall. While fully sun
            tolerant it benefits from some shelter from hot drying summer winds.
            Suitable for small gardens, it also makes a good container shrub.

          <h2>Mikawa yatsubusa: Acer palmatum</h2>
          <p>
            A compact dwarf reaching 5' tall and densely branched. The fresh
            green leaves overlap giving it a unique layered look. The leaves are
            five to seven lobed, deeply divided and taper to a point. The fall
            color on this little gem is yellow and orange. This small shrub
            makes an excellent container plant or can be used for rockeries or
            Bonsai.

          <h2>Sango kaku: Acer palmatum</h2>
          <p>
            This large growing Japanese maple can reach up to 26' tall x 20'
            wide at maturity, but can be maintained as a smaller form with
            annual pruning. Often referred to as the coral bark maple because of
            the coral-red bark which intensifies in fall and throughout winter.
            The small light green leaves are red edged in spring turning a
            striking golden-yellow with a pinkish-red tinge in fall. Best
            planted in a sheltered spot from winter winds to avoid tip die-back.

          <img src="images/satsuki.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Satsuki beni: Acer palmatum</h2>
          <p>
            A beautiful vigorous shrub-like maple which grows 16' tall or more
            at maturity. The attractive seven lobed broad leaf has a rounded
            shape and is bright green in spring with red tips. Outstanding
            orange-red to crimson fall color, makes this maple a nice addition
            to the landscape.

          <img src="images/seiryu.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Seiryu: Acer palmatum dissectum</h2>
          <p>
            Large tree-like maple with a wide canopy, reaching 16'-23' tall x
            10'-13' wide. This is one of the few upright Japanese maples with
            lace leaf foliage similar to the cascading types. The delicate light
            green leaves turn a golden-orange to reddish-scarlet in fall. The
            fairly fast growth rate, size and width makes this graceful tree
            unsuitable for small gardens.

          <h2>Shishigashira: Acer palmatum</h2>
          <p>
            The lion's mane maple is a slow growing vase-shaped shrub-like tree,
            and while it can reach a good size with great age it will take a
            very long time. A very dense and compact form with stiff upright
            branching. The unique small dark green leaves are curled giving it a
            crinkled look. The new growth is bright green contrasting
            attractively with the darker foliage. Fall color is golden with a
            crimson hue. The slow growth rate makes this a great maple for small
            gardens, containers or Bonsai.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-right">
          <img src="images/ukon.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Ukon: Acer palmatum</h2>
          <p>
            What sets this shrub-like maple apart from the rest is the pea-green
            bark and branches, becoming very noticeable in winter. The small
            leaves are light green and turn bright yellow in fall. Slow growing
            it can reach 20' tall with a wide canopy but this will take a very
            long time. A beautiful maple for winter accent and the slow growth
            rate makes it suitable for large containers.
          </p>

        <div class="card-left">

          <h2>Wou nishiki: Acer palmatum dissectum</h2>
          <p>
            Narrow upright maple, reaching about 13' tall at maturity. The
            leaves are deeply divided with serrated edges and taper to long
            sharp tips. The bright green foliage turns a bright crimson in fall.
            The narrow canopy makes this a nice maple for smaller gardens.
