          <h1>Plants for Hedging</h1>
          <p>
            A hedge can be an important addition to the garden, providing
            privacy, act as sound barrier or define property lines. Which
            hedging to choose will depend on a number of factors. Deer will be
            one of those factors and will determine which plants to pick. Some
            plants are quite resistant but none are totally Deer proof, what
            they leave alone in one area they may eat in another. Check around
            the neighborhood and see what your neighbors use if you live in a
            high Deer area. Estimate how much room is available, if the space is
            very narrow, don't use plants that grow excessively wide. Take in
            account power lines, scenic views you might not want to block and if
            vision will be restricted when leaving your driveway. Consider the
            impact a large hedge or screen will have on your neighbors
            (especially in city plots). It will not only restrict their view but
            could create heavy shade in their yard which they might not want.
