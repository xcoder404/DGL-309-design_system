          <h1>Large specimen trees</h1>
          <p>
            These are the trees that often get mistakenly planted because they
            look so good when young, not taking in account their mature size.
            They definately have a spot in the landscape but only on large lots
            or acreage. When planting large trees remember, not near power
            lines, house foundations, septic fields, drive or walkways. Large
            trees grow large roots and can cause damage. Another important
            factor is the size of the house, a single story home should not have
            a huge tree that will dominate the landscape, making the house
            appear small. The same is true for a large home, too small a tree
            and the house will appear huge. The overall landscape should be
            balanced and pleasing to the eye. While large trees are not suitable
            for every garden they deserve mention for those that have the room.

          <h2>Alaska Cedar 'Weeping' Chamaecyparis nootkantensis pendula</h2>
          <p>
            A narrow weeping conifer with graceful horizontal branching and long
            sprays of dark green foliage. While not overly wide, keep in mind
            they do get tall with age. Two cultivars 'Stricta and 'Green Arrow'
            are extremely narrow forms, with the branches hanging tight against
            the trunk and more suitable for smaller gardens.
          </p>

          <h2>Ash 'Golden desert' Fraxinus anqustifolia</h2>
          <p>
            Considered a medium sized deciduous tree, usually around 30' tall,
            it's the wide canopy that makes it unsuitable for small gardens. For
            those who do have the room, this beautiful tree has yellow spring &
            fall color, golden bark and black leaf buds in winter.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-right">
          <img src="../images/beech-purple.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Beech 'Purple European' Fagus sylvatica purpurea</h2>
          <p>
            A large deciduous tree with a wide canopy and colorful purple
            foliage that turns coppery-brown in fall. The leaves are often
            retained throughout the winter. While too large for the average city
            lot, it does make an excellent clipped hedge.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-left">
          <img src="../images/deodara.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Cedrus 'Deodara Cypress' Cedrus deodara</h2>
          <p>
            This conifer and the Giant Sequoia are often planted in the wrong
            spot, not taking into account the very large size and fast growth
            rate. But in the right setting a Deodara Cypress is a graceful,
            elegant tree with bluish-grey foliage and pendulous branches that
            sweep to the ground.
          </p>

          <h2>Chilean Pine 'Monkey Puzzle Tree' Araucaria araucana</h2>
          <p>
            While not to everyone's taste, this unusual prehistoric looking
            conifer, does have its charm in the right setting. Whorled branches,
            sharply pointed, dark green foliage and attractive bark makes it a
            unique specimen. Slow growing when young it will reach an impressive
            size with age.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-left">
          <img src="../images/drum.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Maple 'Drummondii' Acer Platanoides</h2>
          <p>
            A Norway maple with broad light green leaves and creamy-white
            margins. An attractive fast growing deciduous tree it grows tall
            with a very wide canopy. A colorful shade tree for a large yard.
            (Note prune out any non-variegated foliage)
          </p>

        <div class="card-right">
          <img src="../images/metasequoia.jpg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Metasequoia 'Dawn redwood Ogon' Metasequoia glyptostroboides</h2>
          <p>
            A deciduous conifer with striking golden-yellow foliage, attractive
            reddish bark and fall color. The color and fast growth rate, makes
            this large specimen tree a beautiful addition to the landscape.

          <h2>Oak 'Oak' Quercus</h2>
          <p>
            There are so many beautiful oaks to choose from, picking a
            particular one is hard. Most are long lived and become stately large
            trees with gnarled branches, like our native Garry oak. The Red and
            Scarlet oaks have brilliant fall colors. Pin oaks have attractive
            leaves and are available in a columnar form. A oak with yellow
            foliage is the English golden oak.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card-right">
          <img src="../images/spruce.jpeg" alt="customer 1" />
          <h2>Spruce 'Aurea' Picea orientalis aurea</h2>
          <p>
            This Oriental spruce is stunning for part of the year when the new
            tips become bright yellow against the dark green mature foliage.
            Conical to pyramidal in form, the branches are slightly pendulous
            and sweep the ground. Not considered fast growing it can still
            become a large tree with age.
          </p>

          <h2>Willow Weeping 'Niobe' Salix alba tristis</h2>
          <p>
            Stately, elegant and graceful, describes this large deciduous golden
            weeping willow. This beautiful specimen tree needs room to mature
            and should never be planted near homes, drainage and sewer lines or
            septic fields.
