          <h1>Shrubs for container growing</h1>
          <p>
            Containers add interest to outdoor sitting areas by brightening up
            the empty spaces on decks, patios, terraces or entryways and is a
            nice solution for apartments or homes with little or no space for
            gardens. The color or shape of the containers is a personal choice,
            all one color can be very effect, as can different sized pots, often
            sold in sets. There are many different type of containers too choose
            from, find the one that fits your budget and complements the home.
            Pick colors that do not fade into the background of the house, the
            same is true with the plants. Example, a purple plant in a purple
            pot do not complement each other, instead a plant with light green
            or yellow foliage would. Shape is also important a tall pot shows
            off a weeping shrub better, allowing the trailing branches to hang
            down. When choosing your shrubs ask about growth rate, exposure and
            water requirements, not all plants are suitable for container
            growing.
